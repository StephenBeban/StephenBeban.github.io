I am currently working on my [Political Science thesis at Victoria University of Wellington](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/hppi/psir/student-profiles/current-postgraduate-students/stephen-beban), with the supervision of Professor [Jack Vowles](http://www.jackvowles.com/). More details are available on my [Research page](./research). 

I have also been a [guest contributor to The Spinoff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/authors/stephen-beban), analysing New Zealand’s election results (2017-2026). 
<!-- For the most recent elections, this was in collaboration with software engineer and data visualizer [Peter Scriven](https://pjpscriv.co.nz/).  -->

Alongside my studies, I am a Senior Policy Advisor at the New Zealand Ministry of Justice (2017-present), and was previously an [Electoral Research Analyst](https://fairvote.org/author/stephen-beban/) at the US electoral reform non-profit [FairVote](https://fairvote.org/meet_the_team_stephen_beban/) (2016).
