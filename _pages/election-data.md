The below links will allow you to download excel documents for each country that include an overview of the metrics per election, and tabs for the results (overall and by district) per year, for those that were in-scope of the research for my thesis. 

Further details on how I’ve calculated the various metrics in the overviews are included in my [MA/PhD] thesis: [Proportionality and Representativeness in Electoral System Design: Insights from Comparative Analysis of 29 Democracies, 1990-2026.](/research/#proportionality-and-representativeness-in-electoral-system-design-insights-from-comparative-analysis-of-29-democracies-1990-2026---pdf--read-online)

The excels are almost entirely results for national lower house or unicameral legislatures, with the exception of the upper house for Australia and Czech Republic, and the devolved unicameral legislature for Scotland.
